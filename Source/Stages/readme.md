## Stages

stages are new,to add one,please use the instructions below

## Adding the json file

holy shit,this is the **BABY STUFF HERE**

first,add a lil' `{}`
```
{
 "stages" : [
 ]
}
```
now add a `"BGname : "your bg name.png"`
```
{
 "stages" : [
  {
   "BGname" : "BGNAME.png"
  }
 ]
}
```
finally,add the `image name`
```
{
 "stages" : [
  {
   "BGname" : "BGNAME.png"
  },
  {
   "image" : "images/stages/stuckdustbeenBG.png"
   }
  ]
}
```
and if you can't fucking understand json,just copy this shit in the .json file you make
