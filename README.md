## things to know

this engine is `constantly changing,`but NOT every day you expect a update.
i'm testing out new vanilla features so the old stuff is being `reworked`

## Android Port ( Vanilla ) [ CANCELLED ]
`idea from StefanBETA2008`

If you hav'nt heard,there is a vanilla engine in early 2023 of this engine.

## Features

* Android port
* Compiling
* lua files
* more haxe files
* add HTML and make EXE file better

## Why the vanilla edtion got cancelled?

* not much stuff added
* not interesting for the team
* not enough time/ideas
