A engine that made a OG mod [Vs shrek 6 DEMO ](https://github.com/LilDrippyMyFnf/Vs-Shrek-6-DEMO),this engine is really bad,yeah,really bad
you can also find this engine on [gamejolt.](https://gamejolt.com/games/bit-engine/747004)
Also,dont get carried away cause of how fucking bad the engine is.
## inspiration from

* Shadow mario's [psych engine,( download it )](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)
* dumb ideas mixed up
* NO,NOT WOSER THAN KADE ENGINE

* `messed up stuff` coming in the future
## Requirements
* Vs code
* to understand haxe,javascript,json, and xml

## Features/Future Features

* mostly a engine focuing on the chart edtior
* FIX EXE
* `BETTER CODE`

## Future plans ðŸ““

## things to know

this engine is `constantly changing,`but NOT every day you expect a update.
i'm testing out new vanilla features so the old stuff is being `reworked`

## Android Port ( Vanilla ) [ CANCELLED ]
`idea from StefanBETA2008`

If you hav'nt heard,there is a vanilla engine in early 2023 of this engine.

* Android port
* Compiling
* lua files
* more haxe files
* add HTML and make EXE file better

## Why the vanilla edtion got cancelled?

* not much stuff added
* not interesting for the team
* not enough time/ideas
